# Smart DNS installer - sanction-bypass DNS for Iran, in two halves.
#
#   relay  (inside Iran)  dnsmasq answers a list of blocked domains with its own
#                         address; nginx then carries those connections abroad
#   exit   (outside)      nginx reads the SNI and connects to the real host
#
# Run it on both machines, once each. It asks which side it is on and the
# address of the other. Safe to re-run: configs are backed up, and a step that
# would change nothing does nothing.
#
#   sudo bash doctor-dns.sh              install or update this machine
#   sudo bash doctor-dns.sh --uninstall  put the machine back as it was
#
# HTTPS for the panels is optional and asks for nothing but a domain name. A
# certificate is obtained and renewed automatically, proved over port 80 - so
# the name has to point at the machine and port 80 has to be reachable. On a
# relay that port is forwarded to the exit, so it is borrowed for the twenty
# seconds a challenge takes and given straight back; console downloads through
# it stall for that long and resume.
#
# PANEL_CERT and PANEL_KEY use a certificate you already have instead, and
# CF_API_TOKEN proves the domain over DNS without touching port 80. Neither is
# ever prompted for.
#
# Per-client access control ships with this but starts switched off. The relay
# counts each registered address's traffic from the moment it is installed and
# blocks nobody; `smartdns-acl enforce on` is what closes the door, and it is
# meant to be run once there is a way for users to register an address. Turning
# it on before then locks out everyone, including you.
