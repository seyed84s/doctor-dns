# Smart DNS installer - sanction-bypass DNS for Iran, in two halves.
#
#   relay  (inside Iran)  dnsmasq answers a list of blocked domains with its own
#                         address; nginx then carries those connections abroad
#   exit   (outside)      nginx reads the SNI and connects to the real host
#
# Run it on both machines, once each. It asks which side it is on and the
# address of the other. Safe to re-run: configs are backed up, and a step that
# would change nothing does nothing.
#
#   sudo bash doctor-dns.sh              install or update this machine
#   sudo bash doctor-dns.sh --uninstall  put the machine back as it was
#
# HTTPS for the panels is optional and asks for nothing but a domain name. A
# certificate is obtained and renewed automatically, proved over port 80 - so
# the name has to point at the machine and port 80 has to be reachable. On a
# relay that port is forwarded to the exit, so it is borrowed for the twenty
# seconds a challenge takes and given straight back; console downloads through
# it stall for that long and resume.
#
# PANEL_CERT and PANEL_KEY use a certificate you already have instead, and
# CF_API_TOKEN proves the domain over DNS without touching port 80. Neither is
# ever prompted for.
#
# Per-client access control ships with this but starts switched off. The relay
# counts each registered address's traffic from the moment it is installed and
# blocks nobody; `smartdns-acl enforce on` is what closes the door, and it is
# meant to be run once there is a way for users to register an address. Turning
# it on before then locks out everyone, including you.

## /etc/dnsmasq.d/bypass.conf
##
## Names that must NOT be hijacked, even though a parent domain is routed.
## dnsmasq resolves by longest match, so these win over address=/<parent>/...
##
## Two separate reasons a name lands here. Both were found in real packet
## captures, and each cost a broken game before it was understood.
##
## 1. The service is not on TCP 443. The relay listens only on 8080 and 443, so
##    pointing such a name at it makes the client fire SYNs into a void and retry
##    forever. EA's game stack is full of these:
##
##      gosredirector.ea.com   TCP 42130 / 42230   game-server redirector
##      blaze.ea.com           TCP 15000-15100     the actual game servers
##      gameservices.ea.com    TCP 10010, 11000    QoS coordinator, match stats
##      tnt-ea.com             TCP 8095            realtime messaging
##
## 2. The service is reachable from Iran anyway, and routing it costs something.
##    ps5.np.playstation.net is the console's STUN server as well as a PSN API
##    host, and it answers fine from an Iranian address - routing it sent NAT
##    detection to our own single-homed coturn instead of Sony's pair, which
##    cannot classify the NAT properly. Only gst.prod.dl.playstation.net actually
##    needs the exit (it does not complete TLS from Iran at all); the rest of
##    prod.dl and the playstation.com API stay routed with it.
##
##      np.playstation.net      ps5.np - STUN + PSN API
##      np.dl.playstation.net   envelope2, uef, gs-sec.ww
##
##    The same reasoning was tried for Epic's backend and reverted - see below -
##    so verify per-name rather than assuming the rule generalises.
##
##    Epic's game backend is the other case, and the important one. Fortnite gets
##    into a match when ol.epicgames.com and friends resolve directly, and does
##    not when they are routed - matchmaking has to come from the same address the
##    console later plays from, or the game server ignores the gameplay packets.
##
##    I reverted this once on the strength of a capture that seemed to disprove
##    it. The capture was confounded: the bypass had left the console on an Epic
##    address that is unreachable from Iran, so the test failed for an unrelated
##    reason. Epic round-robins each name across many addresses and a few are
##    dead from here - one in thirty-three when sampled - which is why Fortnite
##    worked on some attempts and not others. epic-pin handles that by probing
##    each address and pinning only the ones that answer.
##
##      ol.epicgames.com                   account, fortnite, datarouter, fngw
##      ogs.live.on.epicgames.com          habanero, discovery
##      edea.live.use1a.on.epicgames.com   prm-dialogue
##
##    Still routed on purpose: epicgames.com itself (www and store are 403 from
##    Iran), cdn2.unrealengine.com and cdn-0001.qstv.on.epicgames.com.
##
##    core.windows.net is a third kind again: routing it is *demonstrably* broken.
##    A ClientHello for any *.core.windows.net name arrives at the exit with the SNI
##    missing - nginx logged sni="-" and dropped it - while an equally long test
##    hostname and every other domain came through intact. Something on the
##    Iran->exit leg mangles those particular handshakes. The same host answers 400
##    when reached directly from the relay, so direct beats routed here.

## /etc/dnsmasq.d/no-aaaa.conf
##
## The relay and the exit are IPv4-only: nginx proxies over IPv4 and every
## address= record is an IPv4 address. But dnsmasq's address= only answers A
## queries - AAAA is forwarded upstream untouched. A dual-stack client therefore
## asks AAAA, gets the service's real IPv6 address, and connects straight to it,
## walking around the proxy entirely. Every routed domain leaks this way.
##
## The Xbox found it. catalog.gamepass.com answered A with the relay and AAAA with
## real Akamai addresses (2a02:26f0:3500:...), so the console went over IPv6, never
## touched us, and its game library never loaded. Its DNS log showed the giveaway:
##
##   query[AAAA] titlestorage.xboxlive.com  -> forwarded to 1.1.1.1 -> CNAME
##   query[A]    titlestorage.xboxlive.com  -> config is <relay>
##
## Answering NODATA for AAAA makes clients fall back cleanly to IPv4, which is the
## only path this setup can carry. It is global rather than per-domain on purpose:
## any AAAA we hand out is a route around our own proxy, whatever the name.

## /etc/turnserver.conf  -  STUN only, no TURN relaying
##
## Why this exists: the relay answers *.playstation.net with its own address, and
## ps5.np.playstation.net is the PS5's STUN server. A capture showed the console
## sending eight STUN Binding Requests to the relay and getting nothing back, so
## NAT type detection failed outright - which hurts FUT matchmaking more than any
## amount of ping tuning.
##
## The console sends those Binding Requests over UDP straight to the relay, not
## through the nginx proxy, so the relay genuinely observes the console's real
## public address and can answer correctly. Serving STUN here is the honest fix;
## it keeps PSN's HTTPS traffic on the routed path so sign-in still works.
##
## stun-only is the important line. Without it coturn would also offer TURN
## relaying, and with no-auth that is an open relay for anyone on the internet.
#
#listening-port=3478
#listening-ip=__RELAY_IP__
#external-ip=__RELAY_IP__
#
## Serve STUN Binding only. No allocations, ever.
#stun-only
#no-auth
#
## Nothing here needs TLS, and offering it only widens the surface.
#no-tls
#no-dtls
#no-cli
#
## No alt-listening-port: full RFC 3489 NAT classification needs a second public
## IP for the change-IP test, and this box has one. coturn will not bind the alt
## port on a single-homed host, so setting it just looks configured without being
## so. The console therefore learns its mapping but cannot classify the cone type,
## which lands it on NAT Type 2 (moderate) - the fix here is getting an answer at
## all instead of eight timeouts, and Type 2 plays online fine.

#       smartdns-shape off        remove all shaping, leaving traffic alone
#
#The wanted state is a list of {"ip", "mark", "kbps"}. kbps is kilobits per
#second; a customer with no limit is simply absent from it.
#
#Why this shape and not another
#------------------------------
#Only the download direction is shaped - what the relay sends to the customer.
#That is the direction a customer notices, and on this box it is also the easy
#one: the relay is a proxy rather than a router, so every packet a customer
#receives is generated locally and leaves through one interface, where a
#queueing discipline can see it. Shaping the upload direction would mean
#policing on ingress through an ifb device, which drops rather than queues and
#buys very little for a service whose traffic is overwhelmingly inbound.
#
#htb, not a rate limit in nftables. nftables can drop above a rate, and drops
#are not shaping: TCP reacts to loss by collapsing its window, so a customer
#capped that way gets a connection that stalls and lurches rather than one that
#runs steadily a little slower. htb queues instead, and hands each class to
#fq_codel so a customer's own bulk download cannot drown out their own game.
#
#The address list stays in nftables, not here. nftables marks each packet with
#the customer's account number and tc matches the mark, so the tc side is a
#fixed set of rules that changes only when somebody's speed changes - and the
#question "which addresses does this box know about" keeps exactly one answer.

#"""smartdns-panel - the database behind the relays, and the API they sync to.
#
#This runs on the exit node, not on the relay. The relay connects out to this
#API every half minute to hand over per-address usage and collect the list of
#addresses it should allow, which resolver each is on, and what speed each is
#capped at. The relay always initiates: it is the machine in the harder network
#position, and this way it needs no new inbound port.
#
#One database serves every relay. That is what makes a customer's allowance
#mean one thing across the whole service rather than one thing per machine.
#
#There was a Telegram bot in this process. It is gone: almost every account was
#opened on the web panel and had no Telegram behind it, so the bot's commands
#had all grown web equivalents and its messages were reaching a shrinking
#minority. What it did for customers - registering an address, seeing an
#account, being warned before the allowance runs out - the panel on each relay
#now does for everybody.
#
#Only the standard library is used, so the installer stays a single file with
#no pip step.

## usage: smartdns-cert <domain>        get or renew a certificate
##        smartdns-cert --renew         renew everything due (the timer's job)
##
## Port 80 is the problem this script exists to work around. Let's Encrypt's
## HTTP-01 challenge needs it, and on a relay port 8080 is forwarded whole to the
## exit node so that console downloads work: Sony and Microsoft serve game
## packages over plain HTTP from Akamai edges that answer 443 with a certificate
## naming no console host at all. Rebuilding nginx to terminate HTTP and answer
## the challenge itself would put an L7 proxy in the middle of the exact path
## that took a week to get right.
##
## So nginx is not touched. For the twenty seconds a challenge takes, an
## nftables rule sends port 80 to a local certbot instead, and the rule is
## removed afterwards - including when certbot fails, which is what the trap is
## for. A leftover rule would send every console download into a dead port.
##
## The cost is honest: console HTTP downloads stall for those twenty seconds, on
## the day a certificate is issued and again every sixty days. A download that
## stalls resumes; a certificate that expires takes the panel down until someone
## notices.
##
## If /etc/smart-dns/cloudflare.ini exists, DNS-01 is used instead and port 80
## is never touched at all. Nothing here asks for that token - it is only used
## when the operator has deliberately put it there.

##!/bin/bash
## smartdns-access - change how the admin panel is reached.
##
## usage: smartdns-access                    show the address it answers on
##        smartdns-access port <number>      move it to another port
##        smartdns-access path [new]         change the secret path, or roll one
##        smartdns-access password [new]     set a new password
##        smartdns-access rotate             new path and new password at once
##
## Three things stand in front of the panel and only one of them is a secret in
## the cryptographic sense:
##
##   the port    keeps it out of the way of casual scanning, nothing more
##   the path    an unguessable URL - it is a secret, but it travels in every
##               request line and lands in any proxy log along the way
##   the password the actual authentication
##
## So this can change all three, and the password is the one that matters. It
## is never stored: only a salted hash goes into admin.env, which is why a
## forgotten password is replaced rather than recovered.

#Description=doctor dns tunnel between the relay and the exit (BackPack)
#After=network-online.target
#Wants=network-online.target
#
#[Service]
## BackPack keeps one tunnel running from this file, and redials on its own when
## the other end goes away. Its menu, web panel and kernel tuning stay off: the
## file says so, and this machine's tuning is the installer's to decide.
## The listening end's firewall rule - its port answers the other machine only.
## Loaded here as well as at boot, since an exit's nftables service does not
## read /etc/nftables.d; the leading - makes a missing file (the dialling end)
## no failure.
#ExecStartPre=-/usr/sbin/nft -f /etc/nftables.d/40-smartdns-tunnel.conf
#ExecStart=/usr/local/lib/smart-dns/backpack -c /etc/smart-dns/tunnel/tunnel.toml
#Restart=always
#RestartSec=5
## Every customer connection is a stream in the tunnel, and a console download
## opens dozens at once.

## smartdns-tunnel - the tunnel between the relay and the exit: see it, stop it, start it.
##
## usage: smartdns-tunnel          what it is, and whether it is carrying traffic
##        smartdns-tunnel off      back to plain TCP, now
##        smartdns-tunnel on       start it again, with the settings it had
##
## Either end will do for off: the relay's nginx goes straight to the exit the
## moment its end of the tunnel stops answering, whichever machine stopped it.
## To change the transport, the port or which end dials, run the installer with
## --tunnel on the exit and then on the relay.
##
## The tunnel itself is BackPack, the work of Amin Mohammadi:
## github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack (AGPL-3.0).

#"""Pin Epic's backend names to the addresses that are actually reachable here.
#
#Epic's game backend must NOT be routed through the exit: matchmaking has to come
#from the same address the console later plays from, or the game server ignores
#the gameplay packets. See docs/fortnite-udp.md.
#
#But letting it resolve normally has its own failure. Epic round-robins each name
#across many addresses and a few are unreachable from Iran - one in thirty-three
#when sampled. A console that draws a dead one stalls on that service, which is
#why Fortnite worked on some attempts and not others.
#
#So pin each name to addresses verified reachable. Those address= entries are more
#specific than the server= bypass rule, so dnsmasq prefers them.
#
#The important part is knowing when NOT to act. Epic's address sets rotate
#constantly, so the first version of this rewrote the file on nearly every run -
#and since dnsmasq cannot re-read its config without a restart, that meant
#restarting the resolver every ten minutes, all day. Each restart is a brief DNS
#outage and a full cache flush, which is its own source of exactly the
#intermittent breakage this script exists to prevent. It made a day of test
#results untrustworthy.
#
#So: probe only the addresses already pinned. If they all still answer, do nothing
#at all. Re-resolve and rewrite only when a pinned address has actually died, or
#when there are no pins yet. In the steady state this touches nothing.
